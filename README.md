# Docker Environment for PHP, MySql, phpMyAdmin, Composer using Ubuntu
## This configuration tested in Ubuntu 22

Here I added Makefile to run commands easily. If you do not have make installed on your ubuntu machine then install it first.

## Commands
### sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
### sudo apt install -y make
### sudo apt install build-essential

then from parent folder type make command_name to run command
